The keys are connected in a matrix of eight rows by columns to
data ports A($D100) and B($D101).

In order to read the individual keys in the matrix, you must:
	
	* write a 0 in the bit of data port A corresponding to the
	 	column that you wish to read.
	* write a 1 in the bit of data port A corresponding to the 
		column that you wish to ignore.
	* then read data port B	to see which keys are being pushed.
	* A 0 in any bit position signifies that the key in the 
		corresponding row of the selected column is being pressed.
		
 -- TODO: need a data direction register.
